# Acoustic Attack Simulation in COMSOL 

## How to run the COMSOL Project

1. Open the acoustic-attack.mph file in COMSOL

2. In the model builder sidebar go to Component 1 -> Group 15 Geometry -> Hard Disk 

3. Here click on the Browse button below the File name and select the "shell and disc assembly" Solidworks file included in the zip. The path is relative since COMSOL is running from UF apps

4. Go to the study tab in the top toolbar and click the "Compute button."

5. To view the mechanical displacement plot in the model builder sidebar go to Results -> Sound Pressure Level and Displacement
